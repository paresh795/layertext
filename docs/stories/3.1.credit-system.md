# Story 3.1: Credit System ($8 for 400 credits, 1 credit per upload)

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a transparent credit-based system that tracks my usage and allows me to purchase credits,
**so that** I can use the background removal service while understanding my consumption and costs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Track user credit balance in real-time
2. Deduct 1 credit per image upload/background removal
3. Display credit balance prominently in UI
4. Prevent operations when credits are insufficient
5. Credit purchase packages ($8 for 400 credits)
6. Credit usage history and tracking
7. Handle edge cases (concurrent usage, failed operations)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create credit tracking database structure (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Set up credits table in Supabase
  - [ ] Create user credit initialization on first login
  - [ ] Implement real-time credit balance queries
  - [ ] Add credit balance caching for performance
- [ ] Implement credit deduction system (AC: 2, 7)

  - [ ] Integrate with FAL API calls for background removal
  - [ ] Handle concurrent usage with database locks
  - [ ] Implement rollback on failed operations
  - [ ] Log all credit transactions for audit trail
- [ ] Build credit balance UI components (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create credit balance display in header/navbar

  - [ ] Show credit balance in user dashboard
  - [ ] Create low-credit warning notifications
  - [ ] Add credit history display page
- [ ] Add credit validation middleware (AC: 4)

  - [ ] Prevent FAL API calls when insufficient credits
  - [ ] Display appropriate error messages
  - [ ] Redirect to purchase page when out of credits
- [ ] Create credit purchase integration (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Define credit package structure ($8 for 400 credits)
  - [ ] Create purchase flow integration with Stripe
  - [ ] Handle purchase success and credit granting
  - [ ] Implement purchase confirmation and receipts
- [ ] Build credit usage tracking (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Create credit transaction logging system
  - [ ] Track usage patterns and history
  - [ ] Generate usage reports for users
  - [ ] Implement credit expiration policies if needed
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
  - [ ] Handle database connection failures
  - [ ] Manage race conditions in credit operations
  - [ ] Implement retry logic for failed transactions  
  - [ ] Create monitoring and alerting for credit issues
- [ ] Add unit tests for credit system
  - [ ] Test credit deduction and balance updates
  - [ ] Test concurrent usage scenarios
  - [ ] Test error handling and rollback logic
  - [ ] Test credit validation middleware
  - [ ] Mock database operations for testing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1-1.3 implemented image processing pipeline. Story 1.2 identified where credit deduction should occur (FAL API calls). This story implements the complete credit infrastructure.

### Data Models
**credits table** [Source: architecture/credits.md]
- id (UUID): Primary key
- user_id (TEXT): Clerk User ID
- credits (INTEGER): Remaining credits
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP): Last update timestamp

**payments table** [Source: architecture/payments.md]  
- id (UUID): Primary key
- user_id (TEXT): Foreign key to user
- stripe_payment_id (TEXT): Stripe PaymentIntent ID
- amount (INTEGER): Amount in cents
- credits_granted (INTEGER): Number of credits issued
- status (TEXT): 'success', 'failed', etc.
- created_at (TIMESTAMP): Timestamp of payment attempt
- credit_grant_id (TEXT): Idempotency field to avoid duplication

### API Specifications
**Credit API Endpoints** (to be created):
- GET /api/credits/balance - Get user credit balance
- POST /api/credits/deduct - Deduct credits for operations
- GET /api/credits/history - Get credit usage history
- POST /api/credits/purchase - Initiate credit purchase

### Component Specifications
No specific component specifications found in architecture docs. Will create credit-related UI components using ShadCN UI for consistent styling.

### File Locations
Based on Next.js 14 App Router structure:
- API routes: `/app/api/credits/` for credit management endpoints
- Components: `/components/credits/` for credit UI components
- Services: `/lib/services/credits.ts` for credit business logic
- Types: `/types/credits.ts` for credit-related interfaces
- Database: `/lib/database/credits.ts` for credit database operations

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing strategy found in architecture docs. Will implement:
- Unit tests for credit deduction and balance management
- Tests for concurrent usage scenarios
- Integration tests with payment system
- Tests for credit validation middleware
- Mock tests for database operations

### Technical Constraints
**Credit System Architecture** [Source: architecture/4-credit-system-architecture.md]:
- Credits stored in `profiles.credits` (Supabase)
- 1 API trigger (FAL) = 1 credit  
- Credit deducted only on successful API result
- Middleware ensures: User has credits before triggering API, Deduction + result write to same Supabase row (atomic)

**Stripe Integration** [Source: architecture/5-stripe-supabase-sync.md]:
- Stripe Checkout Session → webhook (payment success)
- Webhook function: Validates session, Applies 400 credits, Logs to `credit_logs` table, Idempotency enforced via `credit_grant_id`

**Tech Stack** [Source: architecture/2-stack-summary.md]:
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Payments: Stripe (1 plan: $8 → 400 credits)
- Frontend: Next.js 14 + ShadCN UI

### Testing
No specific testing standards found in architecture docs. Will implement:
- Unit tests for credit balance management and deduction logic
- Tests for atomic credit operations and race condition handling
- Integration tests with Stripe payment system
- Tests for credit validation and middleware
- Database transaction tests for credit operations
- Performance tests for real-time credit balance updates
