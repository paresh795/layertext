# Story 2.2: Live Text Input + Editing

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to add and edit text directly on my image with real-time visual feedback,
**so that** I can see exactly how my text will look as I type and make immediate adjustments.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Inline text editing
3. Real-time preview of text changes
4. Text cursor and selection handling
5. Auto-save text changes
6. Keyboard shortcuts for common operations

  - [ ] Test inline editing behavior
  - [ ] Test real-time preview updates
  - [ ] Test keyboard shortcuts
  - [ ] Test auto-save functionality
  - [ ] Mock canvas interactions for testing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.1 created the text layer management system. This story builds upon that foundation to enable interactive text editing directly on the canvas.

### Data Models
**Text Layer Integration** (builds on Story 2.1):
```typescript
interface TextLayer {
  id: string;
  content: string; // Updated in real-time by this story
  style: TextStyle;
  position: Position;
  visible: boolean;
  zIndex: number;
  isEditing?: boolean; // New property for editing state
}

interface TextEditingState {
  activeLayerId: string | null;
  cursorPosition: number;
  selectionStart: number;
  selectionEnd: number;
}
```

### API Specifications
No specific API endpoints defined in architecture docs for text editing. This is primarily client-side interactive functionality.

### Component Specifications  
No specific component specifications found in architecture docs. Will create text editing components using ShadCN UI components for consistent styling and accessibility.

### File Locations
Based on Next.js 14 App Router structure:
- Components: `/components/text-editor/TextInput.tsx` for inline editing
- Components: `/components/text-editor/TextEditingOverlay.tsx` for canvas overlay
- Hooks: `/hooks/useTextEditing.ts` for editing state management
- Types: `/types/text-editing.ts` for editing-related interfaces
- Utils: `/lib/utils/text-editing.ts` for text manipulation utilities

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing strategy found in architecture docs. Will implement:
- Unit tests for text input and editing functionality
- Tests for real-time preview updates
- Tests for keyboard shortcuts and controls
- Component tests for editing UI
- Integration tests with canvas rendering and layer management

### Technical Constraints
**Canvas Integration** [Source: architecture/2-stack-summary.md, 3-core-data-flow.md]:
- Rendering: Canvas rendering in-browser (text overlay + PNG export)
- Real-time updates must integrate with canvas rendering system
- Text editing must maintain synchronization with canvas display

**User Experience Requirements**:
- Real-time feedback is essential for user experience
- Text editing must feel responsive and natural
- Integration with existing layer management from Story 2.1

**Tech Stack** [Source: architecture/2-stack-summary.md]:
- Frontend: Next.js 14 + ShadCN UI
- Interactive editing requires efficient state management and canvas updates

### Testing
No specific testing standards found in architecture docs. Will implement:
- Unit tests for text input handling and real-time updates
- Tests for click-to-add functionality
- Tests for keyboard shortcuts and text manipulation
- Component tests for editing UI and user interactions
- Integration tests with layer management system from Story 2.1
- Performance tests for real-time preview updates
