## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the first story in the project.

### Data Models
**uploads table** [Source: architecture/uploads.md]
- id (UUID): Primary key
- user_id (TEXT): Foreign key to user (Clerk ID)
- image_url (TEXT): Original uploaded image URL
- fal_output_url (TEXT): Foreground-only image (PNG from FAL API) - will be populated in later story
- created_at (TIMESTAMP): Time of upload and processing
- status (TEXT): Status of processing (e.g., 'pending', 'complete')
- credit_used (BOOLEAN): Whether credit has been consumed

### API Specifications
No specific API endpoints defined in architecture docs for this story. Upload will use Supabase Storage direct upload functionality.

### Component Specifications
No specific component specifications found in architecture docs. Will use ShadCN UI components for consistent styling.

### File Locations
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for project structure. Will follow Next.js 14 App Router conventions:
- Components: `/components/upload/`
- Pages: `/app/` (App Router structure)
- Types: `/types/` or `/lib/types/`

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing strategy found in architecture docs. Will implement standard unit tests using Next.js testing patterns.

### Technical Constraints
**Tech Stack** [Source: prd/technical-stack.md]:
- Next.js (App Router)
- ShadCN (Tailwind UI)
- Clerk (Auth)
- Supabase (Database + Storage)
- Client Rendering: HTML/CSS/JS layer with image/text composition

**Storage** [Source: architecture/2-stack-summary.md]:
- Supabase Storage for image uploads and exports

**File Format Requirements** [Source: architecture/7-file-format-enforcement.md]:
- Support JPG and PNG formats only
- Maintain image quality and resolution

### Testing
No specific testing standards found in architecture docs. Will implement:
- Unit tests for file validation logic
- Component tests for upload interface
- Integration tests for Supabase storage interaction
- Error handling tests for various failure scenarios
