## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 3.1 and 3.2 created the credit system and user authentication. This story integrates payment processing to allow users to purchase credits securely.

### Data Models
**payments table** [Source: architecture/payments.md]
- id (UUID): Primary key
- user_id (TEXT): Foreign key to user
- stripe_payment_id (TEXT): Stripe PaymentIntent ID
- amount (INTEGER): Amount in cents (800 for $8.00)
- credits_granted (INTEGER): Number of credits issued (400)
- status (TEXT): 'success', 'failed', etc.
- created_at (TIMESTAMP): Timestamp of payment attempt
- credit_grant_id (TEXT): Idempotency field to avoid duplication

**Credit Package Definition**:
- Package: $8.00 USD = 400 credits
- Amount in cents: 800
- Credit-to-dollar ratio: 50 credits per $1

### API Specifications
**Stripe API Integration**:
- Stripe Checkout Sessions for payment processing
- Stripe PaymentIntents for payment tracking
- Stripe Webhooks for payment confirmations

**Internal API Endpoints** (to be created):
- POST /api/payments/create-session - Create Stripe checkout session
- POST /api/payments/webhook - Handle Stripe webhooks
- GET /api/payments/history - Get user payment history
- POST /api/payments/refund - Process refunds

### Component Specifications
No specific component specifications found in architecture docs. Will create payment components using Stripe Elements and ShadCN UI for consistent styling.

### File Locations
Based on Next.js 14 App Router structure:
- API routes: `/app/api/payments/` for payment processing endpoints
- Components: `/components/payments/` for payment UI components
- Services: `/lib/services/stripe.ts` for Stripe business logic
- Types: `/types/payments.ts` for payment-related interfaces
- Webhooks: `/app/api/webhooks/stripe.ts` for Stripe webhook handling

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing strategy found in architecture docs. Will implement:
- Unit tests for Stripe integration
- Tests for payment flow and checkout sessions
- Tests for webhook handling and validation
- Tests for refund processing
- Mock tests for Stripe API interactions

### Technical Constraints
**Payment Architecture** [Source: architecture/2-stack-summary.md]:
- Payments: Stripe (1 plan: $8 → 400 credits)
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for payment records

**Stripe-Supabase Sync** [Source: architecture/5-stripe-supabase-sync.md]:
- Stripe Checkout Session → webhook (payment success)
- Webhook function: Validates session, Applies 400 credits, Logs to `credit_logs` table
- Idempotency enforced via `credit_grant_id`

**Security Requirements**:
- PCI compliance for credit card processing
- Secure webhook signature validation
- Encrypted storage of sensitive payment data
- HTTPS required for all payment endpoints

**Tech Stack** [Source: architecture/2-stack-summary.md]:
- Frontend: Next.js 14 + ShadCN UI
- Payment Processing: Stripe
- Database: Supabase for payment tracking
- Auth: Clerk (for user identification in payments)

### Testing
No specific testing standards found in architecture docs. Will implement:
- Unit tests for Stripe SDK integration and configuration
- Tests for payment session creation and checkout flow
- Tests for webhook signature validation and processing
- Tests for payment success/failure handling
- Tests for refund processing and credit deduction
- Integration tests with credit system from Story 3.1
- Mock tests using Stripe test mode and webhook testing tools
- End-to-end tests for complete payment workflow
