2. Show thumbnail previews of exported images
3. Include export metadata (date, filename, credits used)
4. Search and filter capabilities (by date, filename)
5. Re-download functionality for past exports
6. Pagination for large export histories
7. Delete export records option
8. Export statistics (total exports, credits used, etc.)
9. Responsive design for mobile and desktop viewing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
All previous stories (1.1-3.4) created the complete image processing, text editing, and user/payment systems. This story provides users with access to their historical work.

### Data Models
**exports table** [Source: architecture/exports.md]
- id (UUID): Primary key
- user_id (TEXT): Foreign key to user - used for filtering user's exports
- export_url (TEXT): Final exported image (merged PNG) - used for downloads
- text_content (TEXT): Text inserted by the user - searchable
- font_size (INTEGER): Font size used - metadata
- font_color (TEXT): Hex color code - metadata
- shadow (TEXT): Shadow style info - metadata
- position_x (FLOAT): Horizontal % position - metadata
- position_y (FLOAT): Vertical % position - metadata
- created_at (TIMESTAMP): Export timestamp - used for chronological sorting

**Extended Export Display Data**:
```typescript
interface ExportHistoryItem {
  id: string;
  export_url: string;
  thumbnail_url?: string;
  text_content: string;
  metadata: {
    font_size: number;
    font_color: string;
    shadow: string;
    position_x: number;
    position_y: number;
  };
  created_at: Date;
  filename: string;
  credits_used: number;
  file_size?: number;
}
```

### API Specifications
**Export History API Endpoints** (to be created):
- GET /api/exports/history - Get paginated export history
- GET /api/exports/search - Search exports by criteria
- GET /api/exports/download/{id} - Download specific export
- DELETE /api/exports/{id} - Delete export record
- GET /api/exports/stats - Get export statistics

### Component Specifications
No specific component specifications found in architecture docs. Will create export history components using ShadCN UI for consistent styling and responsive design.

### File Locations
Based on Next.js 14 App Router structure:
- Pages: `/app/history/` for export history page
- Components: `/components/history/` for history UI components
- API routes: `/app/api/exports/` for export management endpoints
- Services: `/lib/services/exports.ts` for export business logic
- Types: `/types/exports.ts` for export-related interfaces
- Utils: `/lib/utils/thumbnails.ts` for thumbnail generation

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing strategy found in architecture docs. Will implement:
- Unit tests for export data retrieval and filtering
- Tests for search and pagination functionality
- Component tests for history UI
- Integration tests with file storage system
- Performance tests for large export histories

### Technical Constraints
**Storage Integration** [Source: architecture/2-stack-summary.md]:
- Storage: Supabase Storage for image uploads and exports
- Export files stored in Supabase Storage buckets
- File access requires proper authentication and permissions

**Database Performance**:
- Export history queries must be optimized for large datasets
- Pagination required to handle users with many exports
- Indexing needed on user_id and created_at columns

**User Experience Requirements**:
- Fast loading of export history essential for user engagement
- Thumbnail generation must be efficient
- Search and filtering should provide immediate feedback
- Responsive design required for mobile access

**Tech Stack** [Source: architecture/2-stack-summary.md]:
- Frontend: Next.js 14 + ShadCN UI
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for export metadata
- Storage: Supabase Storage for export files
- Auth: Clerk (for user identification)

### Testing
No specific testing standards found in architecture docs. Will implement:
- Unit tests for export history data operations and queries
- Tests for search, filtering, and pagination functionality
- Tests for thumbnail generation and file handling
- Component tests for responsive UI and user interactions
- Integration tests with Supabase Storage and database
- Performance tests for large export history datasets
- Accessibility tests for responsive design compliance
- User workflow tests for complete export history management
