# Story 2.4: Drag-and-Drop Text Placement

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to intuitively position and manipulate text elements on my image using drag-and-drop interactions,
**so that** I can precisely place text exactly where I want it with visual guidance and control.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Click and drag to move text layers
2. Visual guides for alignment (snap-to-grid, center guides)
3. Rotation handles for text orientation
4. Resize handles for text bounding boxes
5. Z-index control (bring to front/send to back)
6. Precision positioning with arrow keys
7. Lock position option to prevent accidental moves

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 2.1-2.3 created the text layer management, editing, and styling systems. This story adds the final piece of intuitive positioning and manipulation.

### Data Models
**Extended Text Layer Position** (builds on previous stories):
```typescript
interface TextPosition {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  rotation: number;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  locked: boolean;
}

interface TextLayer {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  style: TextStyle;
  position: TextPosition; // Enhanced positioning data
  visible: boolean;
  zIndex: number;
  isEditing?: boolean;
  isSelected?: boolean;
  boundingBox?: {
    x: number;
    y: number;
    width: number;
    height: number;
  };
}
```

**exports table relationship** [Source: architecture/exports.md]
- Maps to position_x, position_y columns (percentage-based positioning)
- This story handles the positioning that gets exported

### API Specifications
No specific API endpoints defined in architecture docs for text positioning. This is primarily client-side interaction and canvas manipulation.

### Component Specifications
No specific component specifications found in architecture docs. Will create interactive positioning components using ShadCN UI and canvas-based drag-and-drop interactions.

### File Locations
Based on Next.js 14 App Router structure:
- Components: `/components/text-editor/DraggableText.tsx` for draggable text layers
- Components: `/components/text-editor/PositionControls.tsx` for positioning UI
- Components: `/components/text-editor/AlignmentGuides.tsx` for visual guides
- Hooks: `/hooks/useDragAndDrop.ts` for drag-and-drop logic
- Types: `/types/text-positioning.ts` for positioning interfaces
- Utils: `/lib/utils/positioning.ts` for coordinate calculations

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing strategy found in architecture docs. Will implement:
- Unit tests for drag-and-drop coordinate calculations
- Tests for alignment guide functionality
- Tests for rotation and resize operations
- Component tests for positioning UI
- Integration tests with canvas rendering and layer management

### Technical Constraints
**Canvas Coordinate System** [Source: architecture/2-stack-summary.md, 3-core-data-flow.md]:
- Rendering: Canvas rendering in-browser (text overlay + PNG export)
- Positioning must work with canvas coordinate system
- Text positioning must be scalable and responsive

**Export Integration** [Source: architecture/exports.md]:
- Position data must be compatible with export table schema
- Positions stored as percentage values (position_x, position_y as FLOAT)
- Positioning must be preserved in final PNG export

**User Experience Requirements**:
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interactions expected by users
- Visual feedback essential for positioning tasks
- Precision controls needed for fine-tuning

**Tech Stack** [Source: architecture/2-stack-summary.md]:
- Frontend: Next.js 14 + ShadCN UI
- Canvas-based interaction system
- Real-time positioning updates

### Testing
No specific testing standards found in architecture docs. Will implement:
- Unit tests for positioning calculations and coordinate transformations
- Tests for drag-and-drop interaction handling
- Tests for alignment guides and snap-to functionality
- Tests for rotation and resize operations
- Component tests for positioning UI and controls
- Integration tests with text layer management system
- User interaction tests for drag-and-drop behavior
