# Story 1.3: PNG Export

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to export my final image with text layers as a high-quality PNG file,
**so that** I can download and use my completed image with text overlays.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Render all text layers onto the image
2. Maintain image quality and resolution
3. Support transparent backgrounds where applicable
4. Provide download functionality
5. Generate unique filename for each export
6. Handle large image exports efficiently

  - [ ] Create canvas component for image + text composition
  - [ ] Render background/foreground image layers
  - [ ] Overlay all text layers with proper positioning
  - [ ] Maintain original image resolution and quality
  - [ ] Handle different image aspect ratios
- [ ] Add transparent background support (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Detect if background was removed (from FAL processing)
  - [ ] Preserve transparency in final PNG export
  - [ ] Handle both opaque and transparent background scenarios
- [ ] Create export and download functionality (AC: 4, 5)
  - [ ] Convert canvas to PNG blob
  - [ ] Generate unique filename with timestamp
  - [ ] Implement file download trigger
  - [ ] Add export progress indicator
- [ ] Optimize for large image handling (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Implement efficient canvas rendering for high-resolution images
  - [ ] Add memory management for large file processing
  - [ ] Handle export timeouts gracefully
  - [ ] Show processing status for large exports
- [ ] Store export metadata in database
  - [ ] Save export record to exports table
  - [ ] Store text layer properties and positioning
  - [ ] Link export to original upload record
  - [ ] Upload final PNG to Supabase Storage
- [ ] Add unit tests for export functionality
  - [ ] Test canvas rendering with various image sizes
  - [ ] Test text layer positioning and styling
  - [ ] Test PNG generation and quality
  - [ ] Test unique filename generation
  - [ ] Mock canvas operations for testing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.2 implemented background removal via FAL API. This story uses the processed foreground image and combines it with text layers for final export.

### Data Models
**exports table** [Source: architecture/exports.md]
- id (UUID): Primary key
- user_id (TEXT): Foreign key to user
- export_url (TEXT): Final exported image (merged PNG) - populated by this story
- text_content (TEXT): Text inserted by the user
- font_size (INTEGER): Font size used
- font_color (TEXT): Hex color code
- shadow (TEXT): Shadow style info
- position_x (FLOAT): Horizontal % position
- position_y (FLOAT): Vertical % position
- created_at (TIMESTAMP): Export timestamp

**uploads table relationship** [Source: architecture/uploads.md]
- Uses fal_output_url as the base image for text overlay
- Links to original upload via user_id and timing

### API Specifications
No specific API endpoints defined in architecture docs for export. Will create internal export processing functionality using canvas rendering.

### Component Specifications
**Canvas Rendering** [Source: architecture/2-stack-summary.md, 3-core-data-flow.md]
- Rendering: Canvas rendering in-browser (text overlay + PNG export)
- Process: Background + foreground layered with editable draggable text
- On export: Image rendered to canvas and saved as PNG, PNG uploaded to Supabase

### File Locations
Based on Next.js 14 App Router structure:
- Components: `/components/export/` for canvas and export components
- API routes: `/app/api/export/` for export processing endpoints
- Services: `/lib/services/export.ts` for canvas rendering logic
- Types: `/types/export.ts` for export-related types
- Utils: `/lib/utils/canvas.ts` for canvas manipulation utilities

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing strategy found in architecture docs. Will implement:
- Unit tests for canvas rendering functionality
- Tests for PNG generation and quality validation
- Tests for text layer positioning and styling
- Performance tests for large image handling

### Technical Constraints
**Export Flow** [Source: architecture/3-core-data-flow.md]:
- Background + foreground layered with editable draggable text
- On export: Image rendered to canvas and saved as PNG
- PNG uploaded to Supabase
- Credit deducted (already handled in previous stories)

**Tech Stack** [Source: architecture/2-stack-summary.md]:
- Frontend: Next.js 14 + ShadCN UI
- Storage: Supabase Storage for image uploads and exports
- Rendering: Canvas rendering in-browser (text overlay + PNG export)

**File Handling** [Source: architecture/7-file-format-enforcement.md]:
- Support PNG export format
- Maintain image quality and resolution

### Testing
No specific testing standards found in architecture docs. Will implement:
- Canvas rendering tests with various image sizes and formats
- Text overlay positioning and styling tests
- PNG export quality and file size tests
- Download functionality tests
- Performance tests for large image exports
