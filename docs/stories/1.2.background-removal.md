# Story 1.2: Background Removal via FAL API

## Status
Ready for review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to automatically remove backgrounds from my uploaded images using FAL API,
**so that** I can have a clean foreground image to add text layers to without background distractions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Call FAL API with uploaded image
2. Handle API responses and errors gracefully
3. Display processing status to user
4. Show before/after preview
5. Consume 1 credit per background removal operation
6. Fallback handling if API is unavailable

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Set up FAL API integration (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Configure FAL API credentials and endpoints
  - [ ] Create API service module for FAL interactions
  - [ ] Implement image upload to FAL API
  - [ ] Handle FAL API authentication
- [ ] Implement credit verification and deduction (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Check user credit balance before API call
  - [ ] Prevent API call if insufficient credits
  - [ ] Implement atomic credit deduction on successful API response
  - [ ] Update uploads table with credit_used status
- [ ] Add processing status and error handling (AC: 2, 3, 6)
  - [ ] Display loading state during FAL API processing
  - [ ] Show processing progress indicator to user
  - [ ] Handle API timeout and connection errors
  - [ ] Implement fallback messaging when API is unavailable
  - [ ] Log errors for debugging and monitoring
- [ ] Create before/after preview functionality (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Display original uploaded image
  - [ ] Show processed foreground-only image from FAL
  - [ ] Add toggle between before/after views
  - [ ] Implement image comparison slider
- [ ] Update database with processing results
  - [ ] Store fal_output_url in uploads table
  - [ ] Update processing status to 'complete'
  - [ ] Handle partial processing failures
- [ ] Add unit tests for background removal functionality
  - [ ] Test FAL API integration
  - [ ] Test credit verification and deduction logic
  - [ ] Test error handling scenarios
  - [ ] Mock FAL API responses for testing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 implemented image upload functionality. This story builds upon that by processing the uploaded images through FAL API for background removal.

### Data Models
**uploads table** [Source: architecture/uploads.md]
- id (UUID): Primary key
- user_id (TEXT): Foreign key to user (Clerk ID)
- image_url (TEXT): Original uploaded image URL
- fal_output_url (TEXT): Foreground-only image (PNG from FAL API) - populated by this story
- created_at (TIMESTAMP): Time of upload and processing
- status (TEXT): Status of processing ('pending' → 'complete')
- credit_used (BOOLEAN): Whether credit has been consumed - set to true in this story

**profiles table** [Source: architecture/4-credit-system-architecture.md]
- credits (INTEGER): User's current credit balance, decremented by 1 per FAL API call

### API Specifications
**FAL API Integration** [Source: architecture/2-stack-summary.md, 3-core-data-flow.md]
- API Integration: FAL (for background removal)
- Process: Image sent to FAL API → foreground extracted
- Credit consumption: 1 API trigger (FAL) = 1 credit

### Component Specifications
No specific component specifications found in architecture docs. Will create processing status components and before/after preview components using ShadCN UI.

### File Locations
Based on Next.js 14 App Router structure:
- API routes: `/app/api/fal/` for FAL integration endpoints
- Services: `/lib/services/fal.ts` for FAL API service
- Components: `/components/processing/` for status and preview components
- Types: `/types/fal.ts` for FAL API response types

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing strategy found in architecture docs. Will implement:
- Unit tests for FAL API service integration
- Tests for credit verification and deduction logic
- Error handling tests for various API failure scenarios
- Mock tests to simulate FAL API responses

### Technical Constraints
**Credit System** [Source: architecture/4-credit-system-architecture.md]:
- Credits stored in `profiles.credits` (Supabase)
- 1 API trigger (FAL) = 1 credit
- Credit deducted only on successful API result
- Middleware ensures:
  - User has credits before triggering API
  - Deduction + result write to same Supabase row (atomic)

**Tech Stack** [Source: architecture/2-stack-summary.md]:
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Supabase (Database + Storage)
- FAL API integration for background removal

**Data Flow** [Source: architecture/3-core-data-flow.md]:
1. User uploads PNG or JPG
2. Image sent to FAL API → foreground extracted
3. Background + foreground layered with editable draggable text
4. Credit deducted on successful processing

### Testing
No specific testing standards found in architecture docs. Will implement:
- Integration tests for FAL API service
- Unit tests for credit system logic
- Error handling tests for API failures
- Mock tests for various FAL API response scenarios
