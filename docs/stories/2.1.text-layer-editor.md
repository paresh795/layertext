# Story 2.1: Text Layer Editor

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to manage multiple text layers on my image with a comprehensive editor,
**so that** I can create, edit, organize, and control the visibility of different text elements on my image.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create new text layers
2. Select and edit existing text layers
3. Layer management (show/hide, delete, reorder)
4. Multi-layer support
5. Layer isolation for editing
6. Undo/redo functionality for text operations

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create text layer data structure and state management (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Define text layer interface/type with properties (id, content, style, position)
  - [ ] Implement layer state management (React context or state)
  - [ ] Create functions for adding new text layers
  - [ ] Handle unique layer IDs and ordering
- [ ] Build layer management interface (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create layers panel/sidebar component
  - [ ] Display list of all text layers with thumbnails
  - [ ] Add layer selection functionality
  - [ ] Implement show/hide toggle for each layer
  - [ ] Add delete layer functionality with confirmation
  - [ ] Create drag-and-drop reordering for layers
- [ ] Implement layer isolation and editing (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create active layer selection system
  - [ ] Highlight selected layer on canvas
  - [ ] Enable editing only for selected layer
  - [ ] Provide visual feedback for active layer
  - [ ] Lock non-active layers from accidental editing
- [ ] Add undo/redo functionality (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Implement command pattern for text operations
  - [ ] Create undo/redo stack management
  - [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y)
  - [ ] Track layer creation, deletion, and modification actions
  - [ ] Limit undo history to prevent memory issues
- [ ] Create layer canvas integration
  - [ ] Render all visible text layers on canvas
  - [ ] Handle layer z-index/ordering on canvas
  - [ ] Update canvas when layer visibility changes
  - [ ] Sync layer changes with canvas display
- [ ] Add unit tests for layer management
  - [ ] Test layer creation and deletion
  - [ ] Test layer reordering functionality
  - [ ] Test undo/redo operations
  - [ ] Test layer state persistence
  - [ ] Mock canvas interactions for testing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1-1.3 implemented the core image processing pipeline. This story begins the text functionality that will overlay on the processed images.

### Data Models
**Text Layer Structure** (Client-side state):
```typescript
interface TextLayer {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  style: {
    fontFamily: string;
    fontSize: number;
    fontWeight: string;
    color: string;
    opacity: number;
  };
  position: {
    x: number;
    y: number;
  };
  visible: boolean;
  zIndex: number;
}
```

**exports table relationship** [Source: architecture/exports.md]
- Will eventually store text_content, font_size, font_color, position_x, position_y
- This story creates the foundation for that export data

### API Specifications
No specific API endpoints defined in architecture docs for text layers. This is primarily client-side state management and canvas rendering.

### Component Specifications
No specific component specifications found in architecture docs. Will create text layer management components using ShadCN UI components for consistent styling.

### File Locations
Based on Next.js 14 App Router structure:
- Components: `/components/text-editor/` for layer management components
- Hooks: `/hooks/useTextLayers.ts` for layer state management
- Types: `/types/text-layer.ts` for text layer interfaces
- Utils: `/lib/utils/text-layers.ts` for layer manipulation utilities
- Context: `/contexts/TextLayerContext.tsx` for global layer state

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing strategy found in architecture docs. Will implement:
- Unit tests for text layer state management
- Tests for layer CRUD operations
- Tests for undo/redo functionality
- Component tests for layer management UI
- Integration tests with canvas rendering

### Technical Constraints
**Canvas Integration** [Source: architecture/2-stack-summary.md, 3-core-data-flow.md]:
- Rendering: Canvas rendering in-browser (text overlay + PNG export)
- Background + foreground layered with editable draggable text
- Text layers must integrate with existing canvas system

**Tech Stack** [Source: architecture/2-stack-summary.md]:
- Frontend: Next.js 14 + ShadCN UI
- State management: React hooks and context
- Canvas rendering for text display

### Testing
No specific testing standards found in architecture docs. Will implement:
- Unit tests for text layer data structures and operations
- Tests for layer management functionality (create, delete, reorder)
- Tests for undo/redo command pattern implementation
- Component tests for layer management UI
- Integration tests with canvas rendering system
