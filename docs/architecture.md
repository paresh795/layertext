# üìê LayerText ‚Äì System Architecture

This document outlines the technical architecture of the LayerText app, describing how the system functions across frontend, backend, API integration, authentication, and credit tracking.

---

## 1. Overview

**LayerText** is a web-based tool that lets users insert editable text between the background and foreground of an image using AI background removal.

---

## 2. Stack Summary

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + ShadCN UI
- **Auth**: Clerk (email/password + social logins)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for image uploads and exports
- **Payments**: Stripe (1 plan: $8 ‚Üí 400 credits)
- **API Integration**: FAL (for background removal)
- **Rendering**: Canvas rendering in-browser (text overlay + PNG export)

---

## 3. Core Data Flow

### A. Upload ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Export Flow

1. **User uploads PNG or JPG**
2. Image sent to FAL API ‚Üí foreground extracted
3. Background + foreground layered with editable draggable text
4. User customizes text (size, color, position, shadow)
5. On export:
   - Image rendered to canvas and saved as PNG
   - PNG uploaded to Supabase
   - Credit deducted

---

## 4. Credit System Architecture

- Credits stored in `profiles.credits` (Supabase)
- 1 API trigger (FAL) = 1 credit
- Credit deducted only on successful API result
- Middleware ensures:
  - User has credits before triggering API
  - Deduction + result write to same Supabase row (atomic)

---

## 5. Stripe ‚Üî Supabase Sync

- Stripe Checkout Session ‚Üí webhook (payment success)
- Webhook function:
  - Validates session
  - Applies 400 credits
  - Logs to `credit_logs` table
  - Idempotency enforced via `credit_grant_id`

---

## 6. Key Protections

### Credit Abuse

- Only deduct after API returns result
- Tie API usage + credit usage in same DB write
- Optional: rate-limit per IP/user (middleware)

### Stripe Failures

- Use verified webhook endpoint
- Log every payment/credit transaction
- Retry-safe logic (idempotent credit application)

---

## 7. File Format Enforcement

- Accept only `.png` or `.jpg`
- Always export in `.png` (supports transparency)
- Validate MIME types client & server-side

---

## 8. Future-Proofing Notes

- Supabase RLS enabled to prevent data leakage
- Clerk used for all frontend pages (gated access to editor/dashboard)
- No mobile UX supported in V1
- All past exports retrievable via `/account`

## Database Schema


# Database Schema ‚Äì LayerText

This schema supports user management, credit tracking, image processing, and export history.

---

## `users` (managed by Clerk)

Authentication and user metadata is handled via Clerk. No direct table unless extended.

---

## `credits`
